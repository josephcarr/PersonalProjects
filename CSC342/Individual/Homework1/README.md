## Reflection
This assignment was very fun and interesting to figure out. It was kind of tough for me considering I am not a very creative person, but I impressed myself with what
I could accomplish with HTML and CSS. Part 1 of the homework was the least difficult for me since I was starting a webpage from scratch and I could match CSS styles for
the content. Part 2 was more difficult for me because the webpage was already created with set div locations, so it was hard to try and format everything the way I wanted.
