This project was very fun and interesting to create. Trying to figure out how to calculate multiple
numbers without pressing the equal button was difficult to implement using state behaviors.
Also, just making the calculator display look good for a traditional calculator was very
interesting and a little difficult, but I feel very satisfied with the assignment.
