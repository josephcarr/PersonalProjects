# Title: ParkQuest

## Problem/Need:
There are many individuals that have a desire to explore outdoor spaces and parks but struggle to find motivation or guidance.
ParkQuest aims to address this by providing a platform where users can track their park visits, share experiences, and engage with a community of
like-minded individuals. The target users could include outdoor enthusiasts, families looking for recreational activities, or people just wanting to
have a walk or run in nature.

## Features:

### User Registration and Profile Creation:
Users can sign up and create profiles within the application, providing basic information such as name, email, and preferences related to outdoor activities. Profiles
will also be used to connect to others and save the user's stats to share.

### Park Tracking:
Utilizing GPS technology and the Google Maps API, the application automatically tracks users' visits to parks when they enter designated park areas.
This information is recorded and displayed in the user's profile, allowing them to track their routes, explore new locations, or see available landmarks or rest areas.

### Photo Sharing:
Users can capture and share photos of their park visits within the application. These photos can be accompanied by captions and tagged with the park's name for easy
identification. This feature allows users to showcase their experiences and inspire others to explore new parks.

### Reward System:
ParkQuest incentivizes users to visit more parks through a reward system. Users earn virtual badges or points for reaching milestones such as visiting
10, 20, or 30 parks. Additionally, they may receive discounts or prizes from partnering organizations, encouraging continued engagement with the application.

### Leaderboard:
A leaderboard displays the top users based on the number of parks visited or other relevant metrics. This fosters friendly competition among users and
motivates them to explore new parks to climb the ranks.

### Park Recommendations:
The application suggests nearby parks based on the user's location and preferences. Users can also browse a directory of parks, read reviews, and see photos shared
by other users, making it easier to discover new outdoor spaces to explore.

### Social Integration:
Users can connect with friends, follow other users, and like or comment on their park visits and photos. This social aspect adds a community element
to the application, allowing users to share tips, recommendations, and experiences with each other.

## Technologies Used:

* Google Maps API for location tracking and park identification.
* GPS technology for precise location tracking.
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure user privacy and data security.
* Database to store user data and information

## Potential Extensions:

* Integration with fitness trackers to track the distance walked or calories burned during park visits.
* Integration with weather APIs to provide real-time weather updates for park locations, helping users plan their outdoor activities more effectively.

## Benefits of ParkQuest as a PWA:

Utilizing the capabilities of Progressive Web Application capabilities will allow for the best user experience for the ParkQuest application.
It will also for better functionality and accessibility. Here are some of the benefits of making ParkQuest a PWA that will help enhace the functionalities:

### Offline Availability:
With PWA capabilities, the essential elements of the application, such as park information, photos, and user data, can be downloaded and available to use at all times.
This allows access to previously viewed parks and their profiles even when they are offline or in areas with poor internet connectivity.
This feature ensures uninterrupted access to the application's core functionalities, allowing users to plan their park visits and track their progress regardless
of their internet connection status.

### Push Notifications:
For moblile devices, ParkQuest can send push notifications to users to provide updates on new park recommendations, milestones, or community activity.
For example, users can receive notifications when they earn virtual badges for visiting a certain number of parks or when their friends comment on their park visits.
By utilizing push notifications, ParkQuest can increase engagement and keep users informed and connected to various activities.

### Responsive Design:
As a PWA, ParkQuest can be optimized for mobile devices. This ensures that the application delivers an intuitive user experience across different screen sizes
and resolutions, whether users are accessing it on smartphones, tablets, or desktops. By providing a consistent user experience across devices, ParkQuest
can be used by a wider audience and accommodate users' preferences for accessing the application on their preferred devices.

### Instant Publishing and Easy Installation:
ParkQuest as a PWA allows the application to be accessable instantly available to any user on any device as soon as the application is published.
There is no need to use application stores that need permissions to publish. Also, a user can easily install them on their devices for easier access, and they are lightweight
to take up as little space as possible on the devices.

With the PWA capabilities, ParkQuest can offer a user-friendly experience that encourages users to explore outdoor spaces,
discover new parks, and connect with a community of outdoor enthusiasts. The application's offline accessibility, quick access and installation, push notifications,
and responsive design help to enhance the application's functionality and usability, making it a more useful for outdoor exploration.
