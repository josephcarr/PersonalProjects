This assignment was a little tough for me but I am very happy with the final product. The backend validation was relatively easy to do, but
I do feel like it is not as thorough as an actual app should be. There was also a problem where setting the custom validation message
caused the input element to always be invalid so I only have the default invalid message right now.
