# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think the ungrading practice is an interesting way to hold a course. Regular grading practices have always put stress on me and this shows a more flexible
way of learning. I also feel like the regular grading practice puts more emphasis on how well you remember information and less on what the student actually
learned.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think that this practice will make the class more fun to learn. There will be less stress I will have to go through to make sure everything is perfect for my
projects and homework. I feel like it can be okay to make some mistakes as long as you have the opportunity to actually learn and improve to fix those mistakes
and feel that I have accomplished something.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
